# Gaming Future Roadmap

A comprehensive analysis of gaming technology evolution from 2030 to 2120, exploring the intersection of physics, ethics, and human computation limits.

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed forecast of gaming's future, grounded in peer-reviewed science and current technological limitations. The analysis covers three key eras:

- **2030s:** Foundation technologies (neural interfaces, cryogenic chips)
- **2050s:** Integration phase (commercial BCIs, retinal projection)
- **2120s:** Shared hallucinations (indistinguishable from reality)
